# JiteTEE
JITETEE solves injustice that results from unawareness of rights, and lack of adequate training on self representation for persons in informal settlements who represent themselves in court 

To set up a Python environment for JITETEE, you can follow these steps:

    Install Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system.

    Create a virtual environment: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to isolate the dependencies for JITETEE from your system-wide Python installation. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the desired directory where you want to create the virtual environment.

    Run the following command to create a new virtual environment named "jitetee-env" using the built-in venv module in Python:
```powershell
python3 -m venv jitetee-env
```
Activate the virtual environment: Once the virtual environment is created, you need to activate it before installing any packages or running JITETEE. The activation process varies depending on your operating system.

    Windows: Run the following command:
```powershell
.\jitetee-env\Scripts\activate
```
Unix/Linux: Run the following command:

```bash
source jitetee-env/bin/activate
```
Install dependencies: With the virtual environment activated, you can proceed to install the necessary dependencies for JITETEE. Typically, the project should have a requirements.txt file that lists all the dependencies. You can use the pip package manager to install them.

Navigate to the directory where you have JITETEE's source code, which should contain the requirements.txt file.

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will download and install all the required packages listed in the requirements.txt file.

Verify installation: Once the dependencies are installed successfully, you can verify the setup by running a test script or starting the JITETEE application, depending on the project's structure and instructions provided.

For example, you might have a main.py file in the project directory. You can run it using the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

If JITETEE starts up without any errors, then your setup is complete and ready for further development or usage.

Remember to always activate the virtual environment (Step 3) whenever you want to work on or run JITETEE in the future. This ensures that the project uses the correct Python environment and dependencies.

Note: The above instructions assume you are using Python 3. If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed on your system, make sure to use the appropriate commands (e.g., python3 instead of python

).
